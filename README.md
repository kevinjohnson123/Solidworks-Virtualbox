# Solidworks-Virtualbox
Solidworks-VM in Solidworks

Solidworks2015 is only supported in a limited number of Virtual Environments. During the Setup stage of Solidworks 2015 it will attempt to detect the virtual environment. By changing the hardware names in the VBOX machine configuration file we can hide the Virtual Environment from the Solidworks Installer.
